        <p>Whether you're looking for a toilet,
            wanting to leave your bags somewhere safe, <br>
            or trying to book the entrance for a touristic attraction, <br>
            your personal travel assistant has got you covered.</p>

        <h1>About</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>The world is full of business activities,
            there is a place for literally everything you may want to buy or experience in your life.</p>
        <p>But just because a business does specialize in something,
            it doesn't mean that there is not a pool of common services that most of them offer. </p>
        <p>Say, for example, that you're at a restaurant and want to go to the restroom: of course they have one!
            Or, again, hospitals are built to treat people, but they always have large parking lots nearby.</p>
        <p>Then, why not make the bathroom of the restaurant accessible to everyone,
            even if they're not clients, for a small fee?
            Why not reserving a part of the hospital's parking lots for external access?</p>
        <p>This could allow businesses to exploit their full potential and to offer services they didn't even know they had,
        and could create for users a vast and widespread network to rely on when travelling!</p>
